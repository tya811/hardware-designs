10 small lenses
resonating frequency to pick up the colors, not rgb screens
I thought two donut shaped mirrors would do the trick to get crazy zoom
the vertical one bends outward, and the horizontal one bends intward tto make the mirrors face eachother
ou can also make the lense itself a completely circular lens with the same mirror shapes
and then smaller holes, but tens of them and mirrors that point to certain areas (I thought they should be motorized to move and change angles)
and there should be hundreds of tiny mirrors in each hole to collect data from different refracted angles
i think the way to pick up the signals is simply by 1000's of tiny tiny resonator circuits collecting colors from a single mirror in the tiny holes
im pretty sure frequency matching works in light spectrum (radiation?).
