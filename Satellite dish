satellite dishes seem to work by bouncing signals off of teh dish and picking them up when they are focused. 
so the way to search for signals is to send connection requests at a ton of angles and then seeing which way you get signals from.

cleaning noises on a given frequency can be done by sending inverse waves at all the frequencies you don't want to the RF noise the 
dishes hear before they attempt to contact anything. 

but you have to have dishes pointing to smaller and smaller dishes and then pointing to 10 transcevers per signal and per ultra small dish
to get the best possible signal at the furthest possible distance.

so i think satellite dishes can be shaped a lot like the camera

the RF signal energy should carry pretty far, and it will carry further and more precise if you shape your transcievers like the above

it gets mucky, but people are wrong, there isn't much of a force called friction. The energy loss is due mostly in part to energy travelling
at wierd directions and odd angles due to imperfections in materials due to heat, oscillations, metal type, etcetera. 

so always mix your metals. 

don't forget to bend antennas and shit like that and make them get wide and narrow at points and all that jazz and just see what the effects
are.
